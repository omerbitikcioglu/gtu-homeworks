<p><em>"Are robots going to replace the humanbeing?"</em></p>
<p>The intellectual roots of AI, and the concept of 
intelligent machines, may be found in Greek mythology.<br> 
Intelligent artifacts appear in literature since then, 
with real (and fraudulent) mechanical devices actually <br>
demonstrated to behave with some degree of intelligence. 
Some of these conceptual achievements are listed below under 
"Ancient History."<br><br>
After modern computers became available, 
following World War II, it has become possible to create programs <br>
that perform difficult intellectual tasks. From these programs, 
general tools are constructed which have applications in a wide <br>
variety of everday problems. Some of these computational 
milestones are listed below under "Modern History."</p>
<p>Here is the history of AI during 20th century:</p>
